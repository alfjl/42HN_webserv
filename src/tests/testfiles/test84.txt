<h3>User Society</h3>
Furthermore, we are considering creating a WWW User Society, which will serve the purpose of grouping the individual users, institutes and existing interest groups.  It will run the conferences and could also channel the input to the upcoming WWW Consortium.  We expect serious suggestions on purpose and structure, as well as offers of help with this Society, by e-mail to www-usersoc@www.cern.ch.
<h3>Past History...</h3>
You can still access the <A href="Welcome0522.html">old information</A> temporarily.
